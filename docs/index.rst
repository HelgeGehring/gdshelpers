*****************************************
Welcome to the gdshelpers' documentation!
*****************************************

The gdshelpers-package is a design framework for lithography-pattern files, developed primarily for integrated optics.
It builds on the shoulder of the `Shapely <http://toblerity.org/shapely/index.html>`_ project.
Please make sure that you have an initial understanding of this.
Afterwards this package should be simple to understand.

It includes adapters to convert any Shapely objects to gdsCAD/gdspy objects - including correct fracturing of polygons and
lines in elements with less than 200 points. An archaic restriction of the GDII file format.
Furthermore, it allows to save the design in the more recent OASIS-format using the fatamorgana-library, which allows smaller files-sizes and has less restrictions.
The user can use an abstraction layer above these libraries, which allows convenient exchange of the underlying library and therefore changing the export-format by a parameter.

In addition it includes a growing selection of optical and superconducting parts, including:

* A waveguide part, allowing easy chaining of bends and straight waveguides.

  - Includes parameterized paths and BÃ©zier curves.
  - Automatic smooth connection to a target point/port
  - The size of the waveguide can be tapered (linear or by a user defined function), which can e.g. be used for optical edge coupling or electronic contact pads
  - Allows to design slot-waveguides and coplanar waveguides (with arbitrary number of rails)
* Different types of splitters:

  - Y-splitter
  - MMI-splitters
  - Directional splitter
* Couplers

  - Grating couplers (allowing apodized gratings)
  - Tapers for hybrid 3D-integration
* Ring and racetrack resonators
* Mach-Zehnder interferometers
* Spirals
* Superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs)
* Superconducting nanoscale Transistors (NTRONs)
* Different types of markers
* QRcodes
* A possibility to include images
* Text-elements for labeling the structures
* GDSII-import

The library itself is designed to be as simple to use as possible:
